map, which has items
player is a snake that moves along the grid

Basic functionality
    1) grid of 20x20
    
    2) snake is atleast 3 tiles long, on sequence completion it'll grow 
    3) it travels along the gris to eat blocks. 
        the color blocks must be eaten in the correct sequence
        if eaten then playerTime++.
    4) Implement a suitable scoring system
    5) make it moblie responsive
    6) implement onscreen direction control to steer the snake
    7) implement leaderboard using localStorage
    8) implement lives/heart system 
    9) make the snake move faster as time progresses
    10) implement pause 
    11) sound effect on eating a thing
    12) Implement power-ups that spawn randomly and gain buffs on eating them, 
        such as shrinking the snake and slowing it down -> take hearts as cost
    13) diffuctly increse:
        1) snake is more faster with time
        2) items spwan closer to snake
    14) so the color blocks and letters should be combines, like blue A then red C 
        sequence
    15) save game
    16) moving obstacles
    17) add portal + portal powerup
    18) make a progressbar timer and it slowly goes to a tunnell vison view of sorttsas time progresses

have small tooltips like thing to show which block and color, the color can be gradient
show that gradient progress in the background
